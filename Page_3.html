	<h1>What to Do</h1>

	<p>Here is a list of things you need to do before you graduate.</p>

	<ul> <li> <div id="picture_of_seaton_park"></div> 
	Walk through Seaton Park at Night: Now listen children, we're not telling you to go alone at three in the morning or to lurk around and scare your fellow students. And don't even think about it on Halloween. As someone speaking from experience, however, having walked back with friends through Seaton Park in January with moonlight reflecting on a thick layer of snow, I highly recommend it. Nothing will make you smile like making snow angels while your adrenal gland goes mad.
