	<h3>Exploring Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire</h3>

	<p>"Aberdeen is a historical city on the northeast coast of Scotland. From it's rich history and ornate granite architecture to it's spectacularly rugged coastline; Aberdeen has a lot to offer. However, Aberdeen does not attract the hordes of tourists that Edinburgh does and thus visitors often get a better sense of the real Scotland on a trip here. Aberdeen is extremely accessible and also serves as an excellent launch pad from which to explore the beautiful Scottish Highlands. This guide outlines a one-day itinerary which will enable visitors to experience the best of what Aberdeen has to offer."
