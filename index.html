	<b><h1><p style="color:red;">Arrival</b></h1></p>
<p>Check out our Arrival page for information for making your own way to the campus.
Make sure you have cash and change on you. Taxis have additional charges for paying by card and First Bus do not give change.
Electricity here may be different to what you have at home. In the UK the voltage is 230. Find information on Getting Around and things to do off campus.
Most computers, mobile phones and cameras will have an automatic voltage converter – meaning it will automatically convert the voltage to whatever it is plugged into. HOWEVER – you MUST double check your appliances
Some small appliances – like hairdryers – won’t necessarily convert. You need to double check the appliance before you plug anything in.
Make sure you have your plug adaptors (you can pick it up at the airport, or any electronics shop)
Internet – the entire University of Aberdeen campus has wireless internet.</p>
